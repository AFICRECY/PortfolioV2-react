              <p> Recently completing the Full Stack Web Designing Bootcamp with UC Berkeley, I am a newly trained full-stack developer. While I may be new to the field, I bring a fresh perspective and a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development. Prior to this, my professional background involved project management and healthcare policy. However, I have successfully managed websites for various companies, making a successful transition into the dynamic world of technology.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>My ambition is to contribute to the development, updates, and management of online accessible healthcare system portals, ultimately enhancing the accessibility of telehealth services for patients. Alongside problem-solving and pseudocode skills, I possess a comprehensive understanding of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (ES6), command line, developer tools, Bootstrap, web APIs, jQuery, server-side and third-party APIs, Dayjs, Insomnia/Postman, AJAX, Fetch, JSON, Git, GitHub, Node.js, Express.js, REST API, Heroku, object-oriented programming (OOP), TDD, and unit testing with JEST. Despite being new to the field, I am enthusiastic about applying my knowledge and skills in front-end development to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces for web applications.</p>
