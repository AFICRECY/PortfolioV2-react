Deployed Application Link:  https://aficrecy.github.io/PortfolioV2-react/

To increase your chances of landing an interview for a software engineering or junior developer position at a reputable technology company or emerging startup, it is vital to leave a lasting impression. Creating an impressive programmer portfolio website is not merely an option, but a necessity. A programmer’s portfolio website serves as a platform for showcasing their previous work samples, allowing them to demonstrate their abilities both through the displayed projects and the website itself. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to establish your personal brand. That is exactly what I did in re-creating my developer portfolio using a react framework. React as a language, brings together the culmination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My portfolio showcases a single page which can be changed through clicking the different navigation tabs at the top of the page. I have a page for (1) About me detailing who I am and all about my career and education journeys. (2) My actual portfolio section which includes 6 of my previous projects I have worked on. (3) A contact page which holds a form for reaching out as well as my social media information. (4) Lastly, I will showcase my actual resume as well as a list of skills that I’ve acquired. In addition to presenting my work, I infused my website with my unique personality and emphasized my design skills. This can also help potential employers gain insight into my skills to see how I might mesh with their company culture and assess my potential for success in the desired role.

### Installation:

To install this project, a knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and ReactJS framework, Git, and Github Pages  were required.  I had to first install Node.js to my computer and then install the Express and NPM packages. I installed the following dependencies with my npm install (express, manifest.json, react, google fonts, mdb react for styling, and nodemon). In order to create this application, a foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were required in order to utilize all programming languages on the same code file. This Portfolio is a representation of all of my works that I am confident showcasing to both employers and fellow developers. HTML was used in the form of JSX within a .js file. Additionally, each navigation tab at the top of my portfolio webpage is organized into separate component files which hold the code for each tab. I utilized the MDB React styling framework to organize both my grid layout, forms and input sections, and also within my portfolio tab to create the cards. By combining these technologies, I created a clean and visually pleasing developer portfolio for myself which will serve me in the future as I apply to different companies. The user should be able to navigate to the link of my portfolio and have access to a snippet of who I am and all that I have accomplished so far as a developer. The code below make this happen:

## Usage

A well-curated programming portfolio effectively highlights your experience, past projects, skills, and pertinent information sought by employers. By compiling your projects, employment history, educational background, and a brief introduction, you can showcase your capabilities to prospective employers. Emphasizing your notable work and providing concise explanations for each project within your portfolio serves as concrete evidence of your abilities and demonstrates your commitment to continuous learning and growth in the field, helping you stand out and increase your credibility among other candidates. In today's industry, coding portfolios have become a crucial tool for professionals to showcase their unique skills and expertise. As employers increasingly expect candidates to have portfolios, it is essential to be prepared and have a well-developed portfolio to meet these expectations.
